# Crypto_regression
The following work is needed to implement a linear regression algorithm, to go to "predict", compared to the data in the dataset, what can be the trends of cryptocurrencies.
The decision taken is to divide the work into two parts:\
Extract from the starting folder all the files that are present, then 23 datasets, one for cryptocurrency, and then apply the regression algorim to be able to graph the data themselves.\
Finally output a txt file with the mean_absolut_error inside, to understand how much the data we have predicted are appropriate with the work and study done.
The data are available free of charge at this link, where I found the datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory


Va modificata la parte di analisi del modello, bisogna cambiare la regressione linare in un decision tree, da capire la max_depth per rendere i dati ottimali, e capire effettivamente che dati stiamo andando a ricercare
